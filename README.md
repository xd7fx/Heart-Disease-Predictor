## 📈 Model Comparison and Accuracy

For this project, we experimented with various machine learning models to find the most accurate for predicting heart disease. Here is a summary of the models tested and their respective accuracy scores:

| 🤖 Model                 | 🎯Accuracy Score|
|--------------------------|------------------|
| Logistic Regression      | 82%              |
| Random Forest Classifier | 83%              |
| Support Vector Machine   | 82%              |
| K-Nearest Neighbors      | 80%              |
| Decision Tree Classifier | 75%              |



| 🤖Hyperparameter Tuning  | 🎯 Accuracy Score|
|--------------------------|------------------|
| Random Forest Classifier | 86%              |

Based on this comparison, the **Random Forest Classifier** achieved the highest accuracy (88%) and was chosen as the primary model for this application. This model leverages multiple decision trees to improve prediction performance, making it a reliable choice for this task.
