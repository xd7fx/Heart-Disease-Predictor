# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction System

This project is a machine learning-powered application designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various medical inputs. Built with Streamlit, the app provides an intuitive interface for users to input their health parameters and get a prediction on whether they might have heart disease.

## Features

- Interactive interface for inputting health metrics such as age, cholesterol level, and more.
- Real-time predictions of heart disease likelihood based on user inputs.
- User-friendly design built using Streamlit, making it easy for anyone to use.

## Model Comparison and Accuracy

For this project, we experimented with various machine learning models to find the most accurate for predicting heart disease. Here is a summary of the models tested and their respective accuracy scores:

| Model                    | Accuracy Score|
|--------------------------|---------------|
| Logistic Regression      | 82%           |
| Random Forest Classifier | 83%           |
| Support Vector Machine   | 83%           |
| K-Nearest Neighbors      | 80%           |
| Decision Tree Classifier | 75%           |
|--------------------------|---------------|



| Hyperparameter Tuning    | Accuracy Score|
|--------------------------|---------------|
| Random Forest Classifier | 86%           |

Based on this comparison, the **Random Forest Classifier** achieved the highest accuracy (88%) and was chosen as the primary model for this application. This model leverages multiple decision trees to improve prediction performance, making it a reliable choice for this task.
